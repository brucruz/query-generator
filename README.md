# SQL Queries Generator

## Generate SQL queries with AI

### Introduction

I decided to create this project because I wanted to have an AI app that I would use personally and that would benefit others as well. I am a software engineer and I work with SQL queries on a daily basis. I thought it would be great to have an AI app that would generate SQL queries for me, which would save me a great deal of time, as I could use it to generate queries for my professional and personal projects.

I expect that product managers and business analysts will also find this app particularly useful, as they usually have a basic SQL knowledge but sometimes are confronted with complex needs.

But it is not exclusive to them, anyone who needs to generate SQL queries can use it.

### How to run the app locally

1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone TODO: add link
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your environment variables

```bash
# .env.local
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPEN_AI_API_KEY
```

4. Run the app

```bash
npm run dev
```

### How to use it

1. Go to localhost:3000
2. Enter the schema for which you want to generate SQL queries
3. Enter the question you want to ask
4. Click on "Generate query"
5. Copy the generated query by clicking on the "Copy" button
